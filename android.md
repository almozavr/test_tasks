# Twitter Client with Offline Mode

## Functional Requirements

- [ ] As a user I can login to Twitter;
- [ ] As a user I see my twitter name in the actionbar;
- [ ] As a user I can view my Twitter feed;
- [ ] As a user I can refresh my feed using pull-to-refresh;
- [ ] As a user I can view my Twitter feed without internet connection;
- [ ] As a user I expect that feed will be automatically updated when network connection is available;
- [ ] As a user I can tap on 'compose' FAB and get to post new tweet screen;
- [ ] As a user I can post new tweet;

- [ ] Every data-bound operation should have one of those states at UI: 
  - empty state
  - in progress
  - failed
  - success (data shown)

## Technical Requirements

#### Architectural

- [ ] Kotlin is a huge plus;
- [ ] Clean Architecture / RIB / Flux patterns is mandatory;
- [ ] DI system like Dagger (kodein is a plus);
- [ ] Android Architecture Components or any MVP/MVVM/VIPER solution is Ok;

#### UI-level

- [ ] com.android.support.* packages are mandatory
  - appcompat
  - design
  - recyclerview
  - constraint-layout
- [ ] Fragment-less design is a pluss (plain views are preferred);
- [ ] Ogranized Routing (with or without any framework) is a plus;

#### 3rd-party dependencies

- [ ] RxJava(1/2) is mandatory
- [ ] Any persistence approach is ok (e.g.: Room, Realm, SqlBrite, etc)
- [ ] Logging is not required but is a plus

#### Tests

- [ ] Unit-testing is mandatory (Spek is a huge plus)

## Outcome

- Link to the github repository

## Expectations

- We expect that you will show an ability to build flexible and scalable architecture, however don't do overenginering - think in the following way ("I may be asked to integrate som new twitter features in the future. I may be asked to change design of display feed / post new tweet. I won't be asked to remake this into the instagram");
- Despite Unit Tests are required, we don't expect 100% code coverage. Judging on your opinion cover the most necessary parts of code;
- We don't expect you will spend ages making this test task. Don't spend more than 10â€“15 hours on this. If you think you are overrunning the time but have already shown the right approach - write a short Readme.md on what is done, what have to be done, how would you do this.
